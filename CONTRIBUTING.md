Contributing to Deblazer
======================

This document describes contribution guidelines that are specific to Deblazer. 

Coding Style Guide
------------------
The general rule we follow is "use Visual Studio defaults".
* No explicit rules here. We will provide a template for R# or another style enforcer in the future.
* Try to use the current style.

Pull Requests
-------------
* **DO NOT** send pull requests if they are not ready for review. 
* **DO** Run tests locally before submission
* **DO NOT** fix merge conflicts using a merge commit. Prefer `git rebase`.
* **DO NOT** send pull requests for only updating code style or for new language features. The change should add value to the product.

Issues
------
* **DO** search the existing Issue list.
